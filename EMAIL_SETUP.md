# Email Setup Guide for ScholarPathway

## Current Status
Your contact and subscription forms are NOW FUNCTIONAL! Here's how they work:

## Option 1: Quick Testing (No Setup Required)
âœ… **ALREADY WORKING** - Your forms will:
- Show success messages to users
- Log all emails to the server console
- Save contact messages to `contact-messages.log` file
- You can see all form submissions in your server logs

## Option 2: Professional Email Delivery (Recommended)

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key (Free)
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for free (50,000 emails/month free)
3. Verify your domain or use their test domain
4. Get your API key from the dashboard

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

**For Render deployment:**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Go to Environment tab
4. Add these variables:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-actual-email@gmail.com
```

**For local development:**
Create `.env` file:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-actual-email@gmail.com
```

## What Each Email Type Does

### Contact Form
- **User gets:** Professional thank you email with their message quoted
- **You get:** Urgent priority email with full contact details, reply buttons, and call-to-action

### Subscription Form  
- **User gets:** Welcome email with benefits, scholarships link, and unsubscribe option
- **You get:** New subscriber notification (if desired)

## Testing

### Test Contact Form:
1. Fill out contact form on your site
2. Check server logs for email content
3. Check `contact-messages.log` file for saved messages

### Test Subscription:
1. Enter email in newsletter signup
2. Check server logs for welcome email content
3. User should see success message

## Your Admin Email
Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` to your actual email (like your Gmail) to receive contact notifications.

**Example:**
```
ADMIN_EMAIL=yeab@gmail.com
```

## No Configuration Needed!
The system works immediately with console logging. Adding the Resend API just makes it send real emails instead of logging them.

## Support
If you need help setting up Resend or have questions, the system is already working with console logs!
